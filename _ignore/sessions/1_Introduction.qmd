## Goal of this course

This course will teach you how to exploit `R` and apply its geospatial techniques in a social science context.

By the end of this course, you should...

-   Be comfortable with using geospatial data in `R`
-   Including importing, wrangling, and exploring geospatial data
-   Be able to create maps based on your very own processed geospatial data in `R`
-   Feel prepared for (your first steps in) spatial analysis

## We are (necessarily) selective

There's a multitude of spatial `R` packages - We cannot cover all of them - and we cannot cover all functions - You may have used some we are not familiar with

We will show the use of packages we exploit in practice - There's always another way of doing things in `R` - Don't hesitate to bring up your solutions

**You can't learn everything at once, but you also don't have to!**

## Prerequisites for this course

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Knowledge of `R`, its syntax, and internal logic
    -   Affinity for using script-based languages
    -   Don't be scared to wrangle data with complex structures
-   Working versions of `R` (and `Rstudio`) on your computer
    -   Ideally, with the packages installed, we asked you upfront

## Why?

A lot of (classic) theories inherently make use of space (e.g., Allport 1954^[Allport, Gordon W. 1954. The Nature of Prejudice. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.])

- It's where people interact
- It's what people collectivly shape
- **Space becomes place**

Thus, there's a deep intersection or even embededness of space in social science research

- It's what geographers call "human-environment-system"
- But often these links are even only implicit in our data

## Geographic information in social science research

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Exploiting geographic information is not new.

For example, Siegfried (1913^[Siegfried, André. 1913. Tableau Politique de La France de l’Ouest Sous La Troisième République. Paris: Collin.]) used soil composition information to explain election results in France.

## Geospatial data in this course I

In the folder called `./data`, you can find (most of) the data files prepped for all the exercises and slides. The following data are included:

- Administrative borders of Germany (Prefix *VG250_*) are provided by the German [Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy](http://www.bkg.bund.de)(2018). Check out their [Open Data Portal](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/open-data.html).

- The locations of e-car charging stations in Germany are retrieved from the [Bundesnetzagentur](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/ElektrizitaetundGas/E-Mobilitaet/Ladesaeulenkarte/start.html). 

- Election Results for the German Right-Wing Populist Party *AfD* in the 2021 German federal election ([Der Bundeswahlleiter, Wiesbaden 2018](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2017/ergebnisse/weitere-ergebnisse.html)).


## Geospatial data in this course II

- District attributes are from [INKAR](https://www.inkar.de/) and curated by Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR)

- German Census 2011 data are provided by the [Federal Statistical Office Germany, Wiesbaden 2020](https://www.zensus2011.de/EN/Home/home_node.html)

- Shapefiles, voting data, and car-related data for Cologne are gathered from the [Open Data Portal Cologne](https://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/)

- Information about public transport stops and streets are from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

- Weather data are gathered from [Climate Data Center of the German Weather Service](https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/cdc/cdc_node.html)

**Please make sure that if you reuse any of the provided data to cite the original data sources.**

## What is GIS?

Most common understanding: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as specific software to process geospatial data for 

- Visualization
- Analysis
- Interpretation

## Types of CRS

Differentiating between different CRS is wild (at least for me...). You may hear from geographic, geocentric, projected, or local CRS in your research.

What's the difference?

- whether 2 dimensional (longitude, latitude) or 3 dimensional (+height) coordinates are used
- the location of the coordinate system's origin (center of earth or not)
- projection on a flat surface (transformation of longitudes and latitudes to x and y coordinates)
- location (the smaller, the more precise are projections)

*In practice, you shouldn't worry too much about CRS. Again, what matters is that they match.*

![](../img/layers_meme.jpg){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

## Old standard: `PROJ.4` strings

This is how your information about the CRS are defined in a classic standard:

```
+proj=laea +lat_0=52 +lon_0=10 +x_0=4321000 +y_0=3210000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
```

(It's nothing you would type by hand)

## EPSG Codes

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Eventually, it's not as challenging to work with CRS in `R` as it may seem, since we don't have to use PROJ.4 or WKT strings directly.

Most of the times it's enough to use so-called EPSG Codes ("European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy"), a small digit sequence.
